# Datatype
In Java, datatype casting is the process of converting a variable from one datatype to another. This can be either implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual). Java supports two types of casting: primitive type casting and reference type casting.

## Primitive Type Casting
Primitive type casting can be categorized into two types:

### Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion):

This happens automatically when converting a smaller type to a larger type.
No data loss occurs.
Example: byte to int, int to long, float to double, etc.
### Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion):

This needs to be done manually when converting a larger type to a smaller type.
There can be data loss.
Example: double to float, long to int, int to byte, etc.
