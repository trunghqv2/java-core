# Object

In Java, an object is a real-world entity that represents a specific instance of a class. Objects have states and behaviors. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) define the object's behavior. Objects are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java.

## Key Components of an Object
### 1. Attributes (Properties/Fields):

Attributes store the state of an object.
Example: A Person object might have attributes like name, age, and address.
### 2. Methods:

Methods define the behavior of an object and can manipulate its state.
Example: A Person object might have methods like walk(), talk(), and displayInfo().
## Characteristics of Objects
State: The state is represented by the attributes of the object.
Behavior: The behavior is defined by the methods of the object.
Identity: Each object has a unique identity, which is typically managed by the memory address at which the object is stored.
